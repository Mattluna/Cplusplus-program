# Cplusplus-program

# Project summery
This project main purpose is to read the file named "GroceryList.txt". It will also count the total amount of recurring words.
Give the user an idea how many times this said word will happen. The project also designed to write it outcome to another file called "frequency.dat"
Which is used by c++ code to print out a histogram.

# What did you do particularly well?
I belive I did my best work OK the C++ part of this project. Using function to keep the code clean and organized.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I need to work on my python programming because I struggle the most with it when creating this project. I need to remeber that python code blocks
Are different compared to C++.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skill that this class taught me that will help me with other projects is making sure to organize my code and while comment them.
When someone would look at the code they need to be able to understand what going on with ease.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
One thing I did to make the program readable is by using variable names that matches what the program is doing. However I need to work on making sure my code is easier to read.
I made the code maintainable by keeping the code organized and easier to be changes when something new needs to be implemented.
